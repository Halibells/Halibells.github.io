                    <h1><span class="title">About the Author</span></h1>
                    <p class="no-indent">I was born in 1993, and have always been fascinated with character’s motivations and cultures, how insights into these friends or foes can teach us more about our own selves and cultures.<br>
                    I currently hold a Bachelor of Arts in English Film Studies from University of Houston-Downtown where I graduated with a 3.83 GPA and Cumma Sum Laude honors.<br> 
                    I had the privilege of being awarded my senior year with a number of acknowledgements for academic writing including having my senior portfolio “selected for its exceptional quality from all the graduation portfolios submitted to the English Department at UHD over the 2023-2024 academic year”, winning first selection in the Susan Kieran Ahern Annual Portfolio Contest, as well as my essay "Moonlight’s (2016) Reflection and Transcendence of Characters" win first place in the 2000-level contest for 2024.<br>
                    Some of my writing is currently under review for publication in a modern Film Studies journal. Mostly, I want to share that I cherish film worlds and learning by the ways in which they spread to, linger within, and influence the spirit long after they leave conscious thought.
