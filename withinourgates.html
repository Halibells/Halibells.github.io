                    <span class="title">Film History: Afterwardsness Analysis, and Valuable Aspects to Recent Cultural History</span>
                <p>As someone who loves film, being a passive observer of the characters and actions committed in sitcoms watched in my room, Blockbuster films my dad would rent that I would watch in the living room, and even from cartoons and big theater Disney movies, I always admired and highly regarded the virtuous characters. It was not until I was a teenager with the original mail service Netflix that I developed an affinity for color and the orchestration of camera shots throughout independent films. This love for the details of a film’s composition eventually rubbed off on my view of the world, and vice versa; I discovered the impact that film had on my pre-conceptions of various aspects of reality. I noticed the politics and circumstances of my time influenced how I consumed film. Discovering that I am not the only one who has come to this conclusion, and that there is an entire field of academics to confirm these suspicions, has been an elating feeling. Consuming film history with a meta approach brings many questions and ideals. One of the only ways one can have a cohesive understanding of a film and its historic context or effects on the public over time is through this meta-analysis. A process of constantly reframing and recontextualizing a film and its presented message and comparing it to the ever-new information available. As Mulvey brings up Freud’s Nachtraglichkeit concept, roughly translated as afterwardsness, she ties it to, “a psychic exchange between the past and future” (Mulvey). Mulvey uses afterwardsness to explain how the brain synthesizes information from a non-linear archive, because it is a term about applying meaning to events of the past upon gaining a new perspective or new information. “This area of Freud’s work is important… [in] arguments for “false memory syndrome”” (Sutton 396). In Paul Sutton’s essay “Afterwardsness in film”, Sutton goes into the theory behind Freud’s work in Psychology, specifically the term afterwardsness and its connection to Freud’s seduction theory. Sutton speculates, “Seduction is clearly significant… not only because it is an instrumental factor in the development of Nachträglichkeit and afterwardsness, as noted, but also because the cinematic medium is inherently seductive (Sutton 396). This, way film has of implying its action or message and then drawing its audience into its worldview and perspective, is a type of seductive quality most films have. I think this can especially apply to films in the way new technology and cultural movements reshape each film’s message from what it once was. The history of film cannot be separated from the historiographic mechanisms that made up those perspectives; when going about observing and learning film history, especially when coming to conclusions about a film, one must understand the historical perspective of the director/writers, the historical circumstances/limitations in which it was produced, and the audiences’ and critic’s reception of the film. Without these critical pieces of information, the historical conclusions one will draw of a film will, if not only by chance, be rendered incomplete without applying this afterwardsness analysis to a film.</p>
                <p>One of these necessary components to properly contextualize a film within “film history” is the experiences and perspectives of the directors themselves. Oscar Micheaux operated somewhat independently as a black film director, he was underfunded compared to competing production companies and was limited in actors he could cast and theaters he could show his films in. Without understanding this Oscar Micheaux, a black director with his own production company, who constantly pushed and teased the boundaries allowed to be shown by mainstream theaters, a viewer of <em>Within Our Gates</em> might think it obtuse to add Larry (Jack Chenault) into the cast as a criminal. Larry is a cousin to the main character Sylvia (Evelyn Preer) of <em>Within Our Gates</em>, he is a black man who has a not so good relationship with the law, gambles, kills a man, and blackmails Sylvia throughout the film. Oscar Micheaux seemed willing to contradict the caste of black roles for actors in film at the time, away from their usual over-exaggerated, indignant portrayal to a spectrum of possible attitudes, just as normal human beings. This shows with his wide array of characters in the film, mostly black but with individual characteristics and motivations. As Michelle Wallace puts it, “Even Micheaux’s bad blacks are not animals or children; they are cunning… each criminal black is countered with a portrayal of a resourceful, ethical antidote” (Wallace). In <em>Within Our Gates</em>, after Sylvia return to her school with the funding money, even while knowing Larry is thief and murderer, she allows herself to be led around by him, is courteous to him at first, and is ultimately forced to leave her job under his threats (<em>Within Our Gates</em> 42:45-46:35).</p>
                <p>Specifically, the medium-long, two shot of Larry and Sylvia at 0:43:49 to 0:43:55, has our two actors enter the frame from the left and make up the center of the shot. The lighting is a high-key lighting with no backlight. Sylvia leads them to a clearing in the middle of the frame and then sits down to talk. Larry assisted Sylvia by her arm who sits with her legs crossed and faces away from Larry, while he sits postured towards and almost over her. The mise-en-scene of this shot, the cordial but coded acting and body language, the vegetation in the background blowing in the wind all make this shot effective in showing a complex interaction between these characters. In a similar film trying to earn a better reputation for the black community, one might expect Larry to be a white actor, a stand in for the white lawmakers and businessmen that exploited all black opportunity at the time. One could see Larry’s character being used in an all-white film to further extricate remorse towards black culture, but upon knowing Micheaux and his work, one can understand that this film was neither for an all-black audience or an all-white one. <em>Within Our Gates</em>’s diverse character palate functions to add complexity and nuance to the black culture being explored and critiqued in the film. Black women not only faced oppression and always had to be accommodating to white men, white women, degrading legal statuses and opportunities, but were also subject to exploitation from fellow black women and men with their own desires and goals.</p>
                <p>The circumstances and politics surrounding a film’s time period is another important asset in understanding a film’s placement and message when it was made, and its afterwardsness implications of the present. Upon seeing <em>Within Our Gates</em>, if the viewer had never seen an early century film, they could think that it was normal for black actors to be portrayed as functional and as multi-dimensional as they are in this film. Not only is Oscar Micheaux a maverick in his own right as a filmmaker, but he is especially so due to the social climate in which he produced his films in. Most films especially feature length productions made for theaters consisted of all white casts, even with white actors portraying black individuals in black face. It was rare for black actors to play parts in a movie at all, much less in a starring, dignified role, but knowing this delivers <em>Within Our Gates</em> a new presence of respect. Alongside the social and racial tones Micheaux sought to undercut, were economic barriers that restricted films that presented Black Americans in a positive light. There were less theaters for black audiences, less black audiences, little to no white theaters that would show Oscar’s movies, which led to a ceiling of investments and funding he could secure for his films (Taylor 5). “Oscar Micheaux soon learned that with this absolute cap on profits, another rehearsal or another take would mean dollars spent that could never be recouped” (Taylor 5). This meant Micheaux had to improvise on location, cut corners on sets and actors, maximize his effectiveness with what camera time he had, yet he still produced arguable masterpieces. Without this knowledge of the underbudgeting Oscar had to tip toe around, one could notice one of the “flaws” in his films and think of it as a lazy short cut rather than a clever technique to save time and(or) money.</p>
                <p>My final point is on the way a film is received and viewed by an audience at its opening and many years after, this afterwardsness aspect of a film’s meaning. Film history is an ongoing process in which the public and their reception of film are core pillars. The Birth of a Nation (1915) was highly regarded (and still often is) as a fundamental advancement in film for its era and was even hosted in the White House for a showing. “Griffith… went to Washington, DC, where on 18 February [1915] in the East Room of the White House he… screened the film for the president, his family, and his cabinet” (Lennig 121). Despite featuring the Ku Klux Klan as heroes and fictionalizing the history of black Americans in very negative depictions, such as positively promoting slave plantations, it still received praise. When one considers the opening reception of <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, with all the inaccurate and bigoted propaganda being taken in by the populace as a believable fantastic tale, the consequences can seem quite devastating. A similar, but almost reverse effect can be found in <em>Within Our Gates</em>, which was censored into oblivion and blasted by critics as inflammatory. <em>Within Our Gates</em> was shamed for its dangerous rhetoric, even though it only featured accurate representations of black Americans. A person at the time of release upon hearing and even watching Sylvia navigate through Within our Gates might have had a quite adverse reaction to the film at the time, because it was intentionally challenging the status quo. The medium-long three shot at 0:52:11 to 0:52:18 of Sylvia and her two parents in her flashback shows a responsible strong family preparing for a positive change. Sylvia fiddles with a pencil and tablet of paper while the actors exchange happy glances and gestures in their humble but nice living room. The shot dissolves into black, cutting to the next scene. Just having this black family depicted in such a civil and decent light, and then being lynched while being innocent challenged what was happening at the time to black Americans. While on the other hand President Wilson hosted and praised <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> in the White House, despite its lack of accuracy, this film catered hand-in-throat to the pre-conceptions of post-civil war segregated America.</p>
                <p>Nowadays we can view the two films through the lens of modern culture and society, and vindicate one for its heart in the face of oppression and danger, and condemn the other with its open embrace of fear and hate, but neither of the original public perceptions lose value in the film history catalogue. Anna Siomopoulos in her essay “The Birth of Black Cinema,” also compares the films <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> and <em>Within Our Gates</em>. Siomopoulos points out “While Griffith's film represents black male assaults on white female purity, Micheaux's film sets the historical record straight with its depiction of the attempted rape of a black woman by a white man” (111). One of the main arguments in Siomopoulos’ essay is the “racial reversals in the plot of the film are not the only challenges that <em>Within Our Gates</em> poses to Griffith's film. <em>Within Our Gates</em> also counters <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> in the politics of its aesthetics” (111). The essay goes on to highlight the cinematographic techniques Micheaux seems to master in his film, the same techniques that five years earlier audiences gawked at in Griffith’s premature attempts at split timelines in his film’s narrative (Siomopoulos 112). Both the modern and original understanding of a film, as well as all the instances in between make up the whole of what a film is, and the ideals it represents within the minds of an individual. The film also exists as a separate ideal of itself. People’s reaction to that film will also always exist, whether it was written down or not, in the way their actions are later altered or shaped by what the film presented and how they changed their thoughts, or perceptions.</p>
                <p>In order for one to fully encompass film history, you have to learn of the background of the director of the film, the production with its time period, and the way in which audiences have received a film from its release to the present. Without all this and more one could make an assumption on a particular cinematic technique taken by a Director, misunderstand the reasons for the casting of a movie, believe a film would always have been as lighthearted or dangerous as it is during the present, or expect a film to have been a box office hit; any number of mis-steps in logic that would have been avoided with the entire context. Afterwardsness analysis of a film can give the historian, no matter how amateur, valuable insight on a film or aspect of culture. Their revelations can be large or small, such as uncovering new dimensions to the past Civil Rights movement, or just learning about a cinematic technique’s origin and rise in popularity such as split narrative timelines. This afterwardsness process also changes the researcher and alters their perspective or lens they will view new films or life situations through. Film history is exhaustive to complete, and in reality, is never finished, but each new facet of information provides its own revelations and value, no aspect of a film and its relation to the outside world should be taken for granted without consideration of what can be gained from the insight. Film history is important to human history.</p>
