                <span class="title">The Expressive Product of Consuming Practices in <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> (dir. George Romero, 1978)</span>
            <p>George Romero’s <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> (1978) begins in a chaotic newsroom where Francine (Gaylen Ross), who I deem as the main character, is sitting in the production room while a live program in which a scientist being interviewed and questioned by a black talk show host is being recorded and broadcasted. <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> is full of the bright saturated colors that contaminated 70’s marketing, fashion, and other Hollywood films of the era. Romero utilizes an editing style of quick cuts and short shots throughout the film to both build tension, and alleviate tension in frantic actions scenes and pertinent moments of dialogue. Although it is not explicit within <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> that the films take place in the same continuity, the “ghouls” in <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> (dir. George Romero, 1965) and “zombies” in Dawn function in the same way, the disease is contracted by death or by being bitten and cured only by “destroying” the brain, and the seemingly same outbreak from <em>Night</em> has progressed, spread, and overrun the state of Pennsylvania (the locale for both films). As the program divulges some background information about the progress of the outbreak within the film world, and the other producers and executives discuss how the shelter locations are dwindling, Stephen (David Emge) tells Francine to meet him on the roof so they can leave together on a helicopter. Meanwhile, Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (Scott. H. Reiniger) meet and bond during a S.W.A.T. operation downtown, which leads to Roger bringing Peter along to meet with Stephen and Francine for their escape from the city. As the party of four escapes, their character and group dynamics begin to develop during a stop at a gas station before they discover a more substantial respite in the film’s central location of the mall and the storage area accessible from the roof.</p>
            <p>The characters settle into their new location and throughout several sequences of locking down and securing the outside and inside of the mall, the initial group dynamics begin to shift and adjust to the threat of the zombie outbreak and societal shifts that are happening. Roger gets injured being overly reckless while securing the outside doors, Stephen begins to take a more supportive role due to ineffectiveness in combating the zombies, Peter replaces Roger as the muscle in the group while navigating his own confidence and future, and Francine learns how to use the firearms and fly the helicopter, taking a leadership role alongside Peter replacing Roger and Stephen. Just as the mall is seemingly entirely secure and there is a bit of uplifting downtime, the party’s presence draws the attention of a nearby band of raiders resulting in their invasion of the mall and being overcome by the horde of zombies. This leads the zombies to the storage area where Francine pilots the helicopter away from the disaster with Peter, who undergoes a dramatic moment of regaining hope and deciding to not stay behind in the mall. Through its careful depiction of the evolution and progress of Francine, <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> employs the abject artifact of the zombie outbreak to allegorize the culture of consumerism in 1970’s America and the changes it brought to gender dynamics in the United States.</p>

            <p>Before I begin unpacking my arguments about <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> and Francine, I want to layout a short introduction, along with a couple of experienced voices in the field, of Romero’s use of the cultural artifact of zombies which originates from Haitian culture, the zombie’s earlier presence in American cinema, as well as the original concept of zombies in Haiti. In <em>Monstrum</em>, episode fourteen of the second season, Emily Zarka explains the way George Romero is maybe over credited with creating the “American zombie”, and then explains how the cultural concept was present in Hollywood cinema for over twenty years before Romero in such films as <em>White Zombie</em> (1932). However, in reference to his first film, the episode is clear to establish, despite Romero maybe not knowing about the origin of the zombie from Haiti, that “he has a film, that is already, whether you know he overtly understands it or claims it, is a brilliant piece of art, but also human and political history” (<em>Monstrum</em> 09:02-09:24). Romero changed the ways in which the Haitian zombie was used in American Cinema, from one used to erase or otherize black folks, the creators of the concept, to one that at least acknowledges (similar to its original function) and seeks to allegorize and be a metaphor for actual historical and cultural problems. Romero’s first film was received by academics as a cultural statement about the state of racial relation in the United States (incidental or not), but this trend remained and evolved into critiques on topics such as consumerism, sexism, the military industrial complex, and individualism in his later films.</p>

                <span class="caption">Dawn of the Dead (1978) 00:33:48</span>
            <p>In the chapter “Zombies” in Zora Neale Hurston’s 1938 novel, <em>Tell My Horse</em>, Hurston recounts her personal investigation and travels to Haiti to understand and explain the concept of zombies that has emerged in Haitian culture. Hurston details Haitian zombies as “bodies without souls. The Living dead… called back to life again” (179). Despite the understanding of some of the Haitian people that zombies are a “myth”, the zombies of Haiti are not violent or a product of an outbreak, but submissive thralls that have all of their personal motivation and drives erased from their psyche. The victims of the ritual of creating zombies in Haiti are ultimately victims of circumstance, “a man is ambitious and sees no way to get there, he becomes desperate. When he has nothing and wants prosperity he goes to the houngan” (185). My understanding of the original concept of zombies detailed by Hurston, is that this cultural artifact was created by this culture as a result of the history of enslavement that dehumanized Haiti’s founders and was used as not only a way for the people to critique, rationalize, and denounce this horrific past they faced, but also to navigate their fear of it in the present and future.</p>

                <span class="caption">Dawn of the Dead (1978) 00:37:22</span>
            <p>If the original concept of zombies is itself, an allegorical metaphor for slavery and a way to disseminate fears or possible consequences of parts of society according to Hurston, and Romero’s films create challenges to power structures in American society according to Zarka, then I argue that <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> uses the outbreak of zombies to demonstrate how the over-encompassing consumerism of 1970’s America flattens gender dynamics. Then, from this stage of disruption and change, the consuming force of the zombies and encroaching consumerism unexpectedly empowers women to take on the roles originally granted only to men. I preface my argument by understanding how reductive it is to Civil Rights activist and leaders of the feminist and Women’s Rights movement to say that <em>actually it was capitalism that elevated the status of women</em>. I would never discount the tireless, brave, and often thankless work of those individuals. My argument is that capitalist consumerism so overstepped its bounds by the 70’s in the United States and overturned so much of society into a mechanism for production, that it eroded the circumstances that perpetuated many gender “norms”, such as the women’s sphere ends in the home and are the weaker sex, and that men are workers, educated, managers, and the breadwinners. Consumerism was meant to be an extension of the capitalist patriarchal system that preceded it, but its unexpected consequences led to an undermining of the principals of gender dynamics and their validity in the new reality of the 70’s. When women were forced into roles of managers, executives, and bread winners of their households (or themselves), the reality that they were incapable of such tasks was proved invalid. All of this led to the conditions for activism to persuade the public and change the culture. The zombies in <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> mimic the disruptive force of consumerism that swallowed the United States in the 1970’s, which led to women understanding their inherent capabilities of doing the roles previously reserved for men, and Francine seizing her owns means of mobility, capability, and fate.</p>

                <span class="caption">Dawn of the Dead (1978) 00:56:19</span>
            <p>In one of the first scenes in <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> at 00:02:43-00:04:20, there are components of the previous society gleanable amongst the chaos of the film world’s society breaking down due to the outbreak of zombies. The scene is fraught with quick cuts and a discombobulated mise-en-scene of contrast between the cluttered behind the scenes of the studio and the immaculately clean set bathed in the warm lights of the news station. Francine is shown trying to live edit some of the information being shown on the broadcast, demonstrating her editing power as an executive in the news station, however the station is entirely collapsing along with any semblance of order or previous hierarchies of decision making. Just as the other executive removes Francine’s power as a producer in this opening scene, Stephen begins to box in Francine blaming the situational urgency later in the film. Just as the balanced structure of the news station power dynamics, a window into the progress of some work environments of the 70’s, reverts to a binary structure of men and women, default and other, the group reduces Francine to staying behind in the hideout. She is reverted to be protected and moved around at the whims of Roger and Peter’s proficiency with their guns, and Stephen’s expertise as a helicopter pilot to escort them to safety.</p>
            <p>Once the party of four establishes themselves in the mall, the “classic” dynamic of the men serving the role of protector and surveyor and Francine staying behind as a homemaker manifests itself. This leads Francine to directly confront the group at 00:57:13-00:57:16 to say, “I’m not gonna be den mother for you guys”. Just as this gender dynamic was challenged and proven archaic as capitalist consumerism moved from not only exploiting and targeting men for their labor and desires through the workforce and targeted advertising, but also to women, the idea that the previous cultural way of understanding gender was at least incomplete and should be replaced is recreated in this act of the film by the practical effects the zombies inflict upon the group. After Francine’s close encounter with the “monk zombie” in the storage area, she realizes that she must take on a more forward role in her own survival. Julia Kristeva argues in her book, <em>Power of Horror</em>, that concepts of horror, specifically abject objects, can be used to cut through cultural ideas or personal dilemmas by transforming parts of oneself, or one’s culture into something that not only repulses the observer, but represents refused truths or hard to confront realities of their own existence (4). Kristeva writes, “crime, because it draws attention to the fragility of the law, is abject, but premediated crime, cunning murder, hypocritical revenge are even more so because they heighten the display of such fragility” (4). If the abject violation was not only a single crime, or calculated injustice, but a systematic denigration of human potential and value, it seems to Kristeva, that its purpose would be to undermine or show the “fragility” of such a system. The abject horror in <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> are the zombies, but their abject qualities come not only from their surface level disfiguration and defamation of the human body, as this is a pretense to introduce the totalizing march and creeping invasion their outbreak replicates of the effects of consumerism in the 70’s across the United States. It is here with this metaphor, that the insatiable consuming force and usury of capitalist consumption descends upon the group in the form of the zombie horde. Just as consumerism overtakes decades or century old norms of economic organization, maybe unintended but leaving among the chaos an opportunity for catharsis and opportunity to seize momentum for the Women’s Rights movement, the zombies create among the chaos, the realization that little separates Francine from the men, and that in turn she may need to take on their roles of protector and surveyor for her own survival. The overturning forces of the zombies begs Francine to question the box Stephen and the others have put her in, just as a young woman who is economically independent in the 70’s would be forced to question the roles her society conscripts upon her.</p>
            <p>The scene at 01:13:02-01:13:40 shows how the characters are progressing in their respective arcs near the midpoint of the film as they are securing the mall. Francine and Peter discuss how to lock the main doors of the mall to eliminate the remaining ghouls in the primary hall across the fourteen shots that are filled with a full haunting backlight from the florescent lights of the mall and all the light fixtures above the group in the section of the department store they are in. Leading up to this scene, Roger has been injured from being overly bombastic while blocking the outside entrances representing the stereotypical white military protagonist in action films, and Stephen has proven himself a caricature of the upper class academic or professional careerist who the film handicaps by his timid fear and uncoordinated demeanor, yet both were crucial to the group in the beginning of the film. Stephen’s training as a helicopter pilot and Roger’s combat skills to cover Peter’s back allowed them to secure the mall, but through the months they spent in the collapsed and freeform society they create amongst the group, Francine has learned to handle guns and physical confrontation of the zombies as explicitly shown in the shot at 01:13:11 where Francine is dual-wielding two propane torches. The force of the zombies has consumed and exploited Roger to the point of his body being broken, and has created the conditions for Francine in which she not only <em>can</em> seize her own place of leadership and control in the group, but <em>must</em> in order to survive and protect the other members of the party, including Roger. In this scene, specifically the shot at 01:13:23-01:13:20, Francine begins, for one of the first times in the film, to step into a role of leadership and negotiation with how the group makes decisions. As she questions their original plan to close off the primary hall, she locates the car and gets an idea. Peter and Francine then form a plan and ask Stephen and Roger if they are up to it, a reversal of their power dynamics and positions established at the beginning of the outbreak, but natural to conditions they are facing due to the outbreak. The practical need of their circumstances flips the societal roles they initially form because of the overwhelming force of the zombies. Like how the overwhelming demands of monetizing social inclusivity and commodifying human labor often renders initial individual circumstances unsustainable, leading to women having to take on the roles possibly originally left to or conscripted to men for themselves, not only because they <em>can</em>, but because they <em>must</em> in order to meet their needs for survival. The zombies replicate this same “chew up and spit out” function of the retail economy, or consumerism, that the group is occupying in the mall. The same force that created the circumstances for Francine to have a position of power in the news station, through its denigration of human worth, is metaphorically risen in the zombies to create the circumstances for her to rise above the social paradigm once again.</p>
            <p>The zombie outbreak in <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> is a force that does not seek to liberate or empower women from positions of subjugation and submission, but instead only serves to disrupt the society of its normal operations for the purpose of its spread, and to use up individuals for this purpose. The only goal is to make more zombies. Consumerism in the 1970’s did not seek to liberate or empower women from positions of subjugation and submission, but instead only served to disrupt the society of its normal operations for the purpose of its spread, and to use up individuals for this purpose. The only goal is to make more consumers. I argue that the use of a horror artifact in <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> to allegorize consumerism attempts to illuminate the unintended consequences that emerge from the flattening force of the marketed, product driven, trendy economy of the 70’s, and proves the assumptions of the capabilities or designated roles of an individual in such a society as false or flawed. Shaviro argues in their essay “Contagious Allegories”, that the zombies in Romero’s films represent and cause the culture the films are produced for, specifically in <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> they represent the consumerism and instigated activism of the 70’s (90, 93). Shaviro also writes that the zombies are “alive and dead, grotesquely literal and blatantly artificial, cannot be encompassed by any ordinary logic of representation”, that they are able to satirically represent and critique both the logical result and participation in what they deconstruct, which are different aspects of America’s economic system and society (86). This disrupting of the binary of male or female, that is essential to American consumerism to incorporate women into retail sale and consumption, that the zombies “subversive[ly] transform”, is essential to Francine’s ability to challenge the similar conventional binary of male or female the initial group dynamics create for her (87). Francine steps outside the bounds of the expected Hollywood cinematic role, and the role supplanted on her by the group, to demonstrate the superficiality of these cultural expectations. I make no argument that consumerism is a moral force that led to the equality of gender in the United States, instead, like the zombies in <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>, was so dehumanizing that it led to individuals like Francine to be snapped out of their participation and to acknowledge its dehumanizing nature, and sometimes to rebel against it.</p>
            <p>The final scene of the film with Francine at 02:03:28-02:05:07, ends with Peter fighting his way into the helicopter that Francine flies them away from the mall in. Roger and Stephen have been lost to the outbreak and chaos of the raiders invading, and while Peter was still battling with his own confidence, Francine has completely seized her own destiny and is prepared to fly off, alone if she must, to survive. After consumerism sweeps through a town or culture and has rendered the previously able men as broken and left unable to meet the expectations of a situation, sometimes a woman must take on those roles to care for their loved ones or just themselves, thus showing the needlessness and subjugative nature of the roles in the first place. The zombies swept through the state of Pennsylvania and overran the mall leading to the conditions for Francine to not only take the roles the men originally took, but to control her own means to survival in the form of transportation in the helicopter.</p>
            <p>The overall effect of this film on the culture of the United States is difficult to discern, only because of how metaphorical some of <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>’s arguments are and because they are hidden under the cultural artifact of the zombie outbreak, which to some extent, is used for shock value. The concept of Zombies that loosely originates, develops, and becomes popularized by this film and its surrounding series obviously becomes a mainstay in American culture as present in televisions series like <em>The Walking Dead</em>, other films of the subgenre like <em>World War Z</em> or <em>28 Days Later</em>, remakes, as well as a presence in almost every corner of pop-culture from art like Marvels Zombies, to music like Rob Zombie. The film also incorporates multiple aspects of other genres besides horror into itself, making some sequences seem closer to an action or adventure film which also becomes quite popular in certain film projects later in the 80’s, 90’s and on. This film could have contributed to this trend because of its name recognition and the success of its predecessor. For me personally, I played a video game called <em>Dead Rising</em> (2006) as a teenager that so directly copied aspects of the <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> into its game design, that when I watched the movie, I was struck with nostalgia from those memories. The similarities are so striking that the game studio was briefly sued by the film studio. For some understanding of the film’s function of influence into modern cinema, the two directors Zach Snyder and James Gunn worked with George Romero on the remake of this film, which creates a direct line from the original 1978 <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> to huge projects, in both budget and popularity, of modern Hollywood and Cinema. Although this could be giving too much credit to Romero because Horror might have always incorporated revolutionary and progressive ideals into their narrative, <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> is a moment of U.S. cinema that uses a work of horror to undercut the “same old same old” way of doing things that is so often present in film. Instead of reinforcing the societal expectations of its culture, the film seems to aim to overturn it, something that is a clear trend often present in Horror films afterwards, and of the present.</p>
